# Poset
This program includes two executibles - one computes the reduction of a graph
while the other determines the minimum bump number for a given set of vertices.
The minimum bump number is found using an [algorithm that uses lexicographic labelling](https://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/13-14/structured_graph/slides/Pruesse.pdf)
